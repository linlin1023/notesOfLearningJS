someDOMele.onclick = eventhandler is a way to bind event handler on the DOM element for click, 
but sometimes we want a DOM element to do multiple things on a single event.
if we do like this: 
someDOMele.onclick = eventhandlerOne
someDOMele.onclick = eventhandlerTwo,
the second event handler will take the precedence over the first one while clicking happen.

The good news is the event handler is just one way of handling events. 
Dangdangdang~ 
We have a more mordern approach called event listener
If we want to bind functions to browser-level events 
or tie more than one function to an event we could use event listener.

What does an event listener do?
an event listener literally listens for an event to occur and then passes the event onto
the specified function. 

someDOMele.addEventListener("click",reveal, dalse ) //for example  a DOM node <a href="#" />
1. we are monitoring the click event
2. we will bind it to the reveal function.
3. And define how we want the browser to capture the event, 
    if from the most specific node we should set false,
    if from the least specific node like DOM node, we should set true.
    
 the last parameter here is only relevant when you start piling events on top of one another. 
 (bubbling, capture events, event dispatch, DOM event flow.)
